This project introduces an innovative AI assistive technology that enables blind individuals to enjoy movies and videos on laptops. Utilizing advanced algorithms, the system comprehends on-screen activities and provides real-time audio descriptions synchronized with the movie's sound. This narration bridges the visual information gap, offering blind viewers a more immersive and enriched entertainment experience. By implementing this technology, the project aspires to empower blind individuals to enjoy the full impact and storytelling of movies, just like sighted audiences.
## how this work

Our prototype, designed to cater to the accessibility needs of blind individuals, revolutionizes the video consumption experience by providing detailed audio descriptions synchronized seamlessly with visual content. Utilizing cutting-edge object detection models and pose estimation algorithms, our system accurately analyzes the pose of individuals and identifies various objects in real-time with millisecond precision. The dynamic feature incorporated in our platform delivers concise explanations of detected entities at 10-second intervals, ensuring enhanced user understanding and engagement. By continuously updating our platform, we are committed to refining the user experience and ensuring inclusivity for deaf-blind individuals, thus bridging the accessibility gap in video content consumption.
